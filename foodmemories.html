        <p>This past summer, I lived right by Michigan Creamery, and I became a regular very quickly. Their
            allergen-free menu is more diverse than most, and this combo was surprisingly good. </p>
        <img src="images/cakebatter.png" alt="A close-up of rich chocolate cake batter, with chocolate chunks on top"
            width="200">
        <p>This picture was taken mid-quarantine, when I decided to celebrate the end of a hectic week with <a
                href="https://howtocakeit.com/blogs/recipes/yos-ultimate-chocolate-cake">Yo's Ultimate Chocolate
                Cake</a>. In the process, I realized how therapeutic it was to set aside even just an hour to do
            something I enjoy. </p>

            alt="Sushi: a special California roll topped with deep-fried lobster and drizzled with eel sauce and spicy mayo"
            width="200">
        <p>I tried sushi for the first time last year! The Popcorn Lobster at Totoro, a special California roll topped
            with deep-fried lobster, is now one of my favorite meals.</p>

            width="200">
        <p>Surprising my best friend at Mason Hall at midnight for her 20th birthday, with a cookie cake that read 'Bite
            Me'. She saw it coming, but it was still a great time.</p>

            width="200">
        <p>I took this picture at Casa Dominick's to capture a great dinner in their outdoor seating space. The food was
            hearty, and the ambience was warm.</p>

        <p>In this picture, I'd gotten together with two new friends from class to make <a
                href="https://www.averiecooks.com/lemon-butter-garlic-chicken-pasta/">lemon butter garlic chicken
                pasta</a>. Dinner was delciious and I loved getting to know them better! </p>
        <img src="images/thairedcurry.png" alt="A large pan full of a deep red Thai chicken curry." width="200">
        <p>This was the first meal I cooked with my roommates in our first ever apartment. We were so proud of
            ourselves!</p>

        <p>The classic chocolate cake at Dom Bakeries in Ypsi. Tastes best when your friends all grab a fork and dig in.</p>

        <p>A homemade creamy Indian chicken curry by my best friend and I. We plated it up nicely and took pictures on a
            disposable effect camera app. </p>
