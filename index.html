        <p>Hi everyone! My name is Neha, and many of my core memories revolve around cooking and eating - so much so I wrote my college essay about Thai basil fried rice. <br> While my host of deathly allergies definitely complicates this, I've come to appreciate the increasing public awareness of allergies and intolerances. In recent years, I've been able to reliably source allergen information and broaden my food horizons. I'll use this space to share some of my favorite food-centered memories, extensively tested Ann Arbor bubble tea ratings and longtime favorite recipes.<p>
